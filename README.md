# bot-o-mat

Hello! Thank you for assessing my bot-o-mat!
I decided to use React, as it is my most recently learned language and this provided great practice.

Now on how to access it:

1. First, we'll be using Visual Studio Code, Node.js, and NPM. Please install these to your machine to get started.

2. Next, we'll open Visual Studio Code and git clone this repo to your local machine
        git clone https://github.com/ShahedHassan/bot-o-mat.git

3. After you've successfully cloned, lets open a terminal and select our file we'd like to run by typing-
        cd bot-o-mat

4. Since we are now selected under our file we'd like to run, lets enter-
        npm start

5. You should now be in your browser hosting the app! Should look like something similar to this.
